# Solution for LeetCode problem: Find Peak Element4025

"""
Find Peak Element (LeetCode #162)

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always
considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

Time Complexity: O(log n) where n is the length of the array
Space Complexity: O(1)
